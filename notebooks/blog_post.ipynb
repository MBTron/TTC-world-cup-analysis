    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I was one of the lucky ones. Or rather, my mom was (thanks mom!). She won the lottery to purchase World Cup 2026 tickets. So I'm thrilled to say I snagged tickets to watch Team Canada play at BMO Field in Toronto in June 2026.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Toronto local and a public transit fan I'll naturally be taking the TTC (Toronto's public transit). But once I thought about it for more than two seconds, I got worried. We're talking about 40,000+ fans all trying to get to the same place at the same time, then all leaving at once when the game ends. Can Toronto's transit system actually handle that?\n",
    "\n",
    "**We just saw what happens when it can't.** Just last week, Game 7 of the World Series turned into a complete transit disaster. Thousands of fans were left stranded after the game. The TTC and Metrolinx blamed each other. The city had to pass an emergency motion promising to \"do better.\" ([CP24, Nov 3, 2025](https://www.cp24.com/politics/toronto-city-hall/2025/11/03/ttc-chair-defends-world-series-transit-service-as-strong-but-says-communication-was-a-problem/))\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's the kicker: Rogers Centre is literally **right on top of Union Station**, the biggest transit hub in the entire city. You've got subway lines, GO trains, UP Express, all converging in one spot. BMO Field? It's way out by Exhibition Place with **zero subway access**. Just buses and streetcars.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the TTC can't handle a stadium that's literally built on the subway, what's going to happen at a World Cup game with no rapid transit nearby?\n",
    "\n",
    "As someone who actually cares about public transit in this city, I couldn't just wonder about this. I had to know. So I pulled the TTC's schedule data and started digging into the numbers. Toronto is about to host a world-stage event. We need to do way better than last week's embarrassment."

    "# Questions we're looking to answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto is hosting 6 World Cup games in 2026. BMO Field holds 40,000 people. Most of them will need to get home somehow after the final whistle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what I wanted to figure out:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Can you even get there on transit?**\n",
    "- Which routes actually serve BMO Field?\n",
    "- How far do you have to walk from the nearest stop?\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Is the service reliable enough?**\n",
    "- How often do buses and streetcars show up during evening hours?\n",
    "- Do they show up *consistently*, or are you stuck waiting?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Can the system physically handle 40,000 people leaving at once?**\n",
    "- What's the actual capacity of those routes?\n",
    "- Does the math even work?\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't about worst-case disaster scenarios. It's about understanding what the TTC can realistically handle *right now*, based on their own published schedules. If the baseline service is already shaky, piling on 40,000 World Cup fans is going to expose every weak point."

    "# How this analysis works\n",
    "\n",
    "All the code for this analysis is in this Jupyter notebook, so you can follow along step-by-step or run it yourself. I've also built some helper functions in the `src/` folder (see my [GitHub](https://github.com/MBTron/TTC-world-cup-analysis)) to keep things clean. These function do things like calculate distances between coordinates, processing of transit schedules, and computing headway statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I'm using:\n",
    "- **GTFS data** from Toronto Open Data (the TTC's official schedule and route information)\n",
    "- **Python + Pandas** for data crunching\n",
    "- **Folium** for maps\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** for charts\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis breaks down into three parts:\n",
    "1. **Geography**: Which routes actually serve BMO Field?\n",
    "2. **Reliability**: How consistent is the scheduled service?\n",
    "3. **Capacity**: Can those routes physically move 40,000 people?"

    "- Route 929 (Dufferin Express) has the best frequency - vehicles every ~5 minutes\n",
    "- Most routes average between 5-8 minutes, which is decent for evening service\n",
    "- Routes 63, 363, 307, and 929 have good consistency (CV < 0.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning parts:\n",
    "- Routes 504 (King streetcar) and 503 (Kingston Rd streetcar) have poor consistency (CV ~0.5)\n",

    "### What the charts show\n",
    "\n",
    "**Left chart - Average Wait Time:**\n",
    "- All routes are green (under 10 min average headway)\n",
    "- Route 929 has the shortest waits (~5 min), Route 307 the longest (~8 min)\n",
    "- But the bars are all pretty similar length - no route is dramatically worse for frequency\n",
    "- Bottom line: frequency is decent across the board\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right chart - Service Consistency:**\n",
    "- We see some major differences between routes when it comes to consistency\n",
    "- Green bars (CV < 0.3): Routes 929, 63, 363, 307 are reliable \n",
    "- Orange bars (CV 0.3-0.5): Routes 29, 329, 509, 503 have some unpredictability\n",
    "- Red bar (CV > 0.5): Route 504 is very inconsistent \n",
    "- The dashed lines show the thresholds: good (<0.3) and poor (>0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The worst performers (504, 503, 509) are all **streetcars**, while the best (929, 63, 363, 307) are mostly **buses**. Streetcars running in mixed traffic are way more vulnerable to bunching and delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue isn't how often vehicles come, it's whether they actually show up when scheduled. Route 504 might average 6 minutes, but in reality you could wait 3 minutes or 12 minutes. Route 929 also averages around 5 minutes, but you can actually count on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're trying to move 40,000 people after a game, that unpredictability is a killer. People can't plan, stops get overcrowded, and the unreliable routes become bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to note this is SCHEDULED data. Real TTC performance during major events (from personal experience) is usually MUCH worse. Streetcars and buses are notorious for bunching up, delays cascading, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next question: even if service shows up on time, can it physically move 40,000+ people?\n"

    "\n",
    "### Understanding transit capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "Transit capacity depends on:\n",
    "1. **Vehicle capacity**: How many people fit on each bus/streetcar/train\n",
    "2. **Headway**: How frequently vehicles arrive (shorter headway = more capacity)\n",
    "3. **Hours of operation**: How long the window is to move people\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical TTC vehicle capacities (per some brief online research)\n",
    "- **Streetcar**: ~130 passengers (seated + standing)\n",
    "- **Bus**: ~50-70 passengers (depending on size)\n",
    "- **Subway**: ~1,000+ passengers (but no stops near BMO Field)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-game surge modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "A World Cup match ends around 10 PM. Let's assume:\n",
    "- **40,000 fans** attend the game at BMO Field\n",
    "- Most want to leave within **1 hour** after match ends\n",
    "- Not everyone will take transit (some drive, rideshare, bike, walk)\n",
    "- But what if they do? Let's model the worst-case scenario where everyone needs public transit\n",
    "\n",
    "The question: Can TTC routes move 40k people in 1 hour during late-evening service?\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: We'll also look at more realistic scenarios where only 60% take transit, because even that still creates a problem."

    "- Total system capacity for all 10 routes combined is way short of 40,000/hour\n",

    "\n",
    "I wanted to check: What if fans are willing to walk 20 minutes instead of 10? That would of course include more routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran the numbers with a 1,600m radius (20 minute walk) by adjusting the `MAX_DISTANCE_M` parameter. The result? **Total capacity: 12,106 passengers/hour**. Still nowhere close to 40,000. Even at a realistic 60/40 transit split (24,000 riders), we're still 11,894 passengers short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem isn't the walking distance. The problem is that **Toronto built a 40,000-seat stadium with no rapid transit connection**. Every route serving BMO Field is surface transit - buses and streetcars stuck in traffic. A single subway line can move what it would take 20 bus routes to match. Without rapid transit nearby the stadium, you're not going to solve the capacity problem. You're hitting a hard infrastructure limit.\n"

    "## The verdict\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can the TTC handle World Cup crowds?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Short answer: **No, not even close.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me break down what we found:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geographic access: actually pretty good\n",
    "\n",
    "10 routes serve BMO Field within a 10-minute walk. That's decent coverage. You've got buses on Dufferin, Exhibition, and King, plus streetcars on King and Queen. Getting to the game isn't the problem as people arrive over 2-3 hours, so the load is spread out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is everyone leaving at once when the final whistle blows at around 10 PM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Service reliability: mixed bag\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency is fine with routes averaging  5-8 minutes between vehicles during evening service. But consistency? That's where it falls apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streetcar routes (504, 503, 509) have terrible consistency scores (CV > 0.4). You might wait 3 minutes or you might wait 15. Bus routes are better but still not perfect. When you're dealing with time-sensitive post-game crowds, unpredictability kills you. Stops get overcrowded, people panic, and the whole system bogs down.\n",
    "\n",
    "And remember that this is SCHEDULED data. Real-world TTC performance, especially during major events, is way worse. Anyone who's tried to take transit after a Leafs playoff game knows what I'm talking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capacity: the real problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where the math completely breaks down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The numbers:**\n",
    "- 40,000 fans need to leave BMO Field\n",
    "- Total TTC capacity (all 10 routes combined): **nowhere near enough**\n",
    "- Even if only 60% take transit (24,000 people), we're still massively short\n",
    "\n",
    "**The infrastructure issue:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is **no subway stop near BMO Field**. Zero. Every route is surface transit—buses and streetcars stuck in traffic. \n",
    "\n",
    "A subway train can move 1,000+ people every few minutes. A bus moves 60. A streetcar moves 130. You'd need literally dozens of bus routes running every 2 minutes to match what one subway line could do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding the walk radius to 20 minutes (unrealistically far) only gets capacity to 12,106 passengers/hour. Still nowhere close to what's needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best-case scenario:** TTC adds a ton of extra service, fans spread perfectly across all routes, every vehicle runs on time at crush capacity, loading is instant. *Still doesn't work.* The infrastructure limit is hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Likely scenario:** Some extra service, but not enough. Streetcars bunch up. Stops get dangerously overcrowded. Wait times balloon to 30+ minutes. People give up and walk/Uber/call friends for rides. Chaos on social media. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst-case scenario:** Bad weather, service delays, one route breaks down. Thousands of people stranded in the rain. International embarrassment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My confidence level: 95% sure this will not go well\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way this works is if:\n",
    "1. TTC runs truly unprecedented levels of special event service (way beyond what they've ever done)\n",
    "2. Most fans drive, Uber, or find other ways home (not exactly great for a \"green\" World Cup)\n",
    "3. FIFA/City of Toronto convinces people to leave slowly over 2-3 hours (good luck with that)\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto built a 40,000-seat stadium in a location with no rapid transit access. That's the fundamental problem. You can't fix that with extra buses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Cup is happening whether we're ready or not. Something's gotta give.\n"

    "**First, a reality check:** Just this past week (literally days ago), the TTC completely botched transit for Game 7 of the World Series. Thousands of people were stranded, the TTC and Metrolinx blamed each other, and the city had to pass an emergency motion promising to \"do better.\" ([Source: CP24, Nov 3, 2025](https://www.cp24.com/politics/toronto-city-hall/2025/11/03/ttc-chair-defends-world-series-transit-service-as-strong-but-says-communication-was-a-problem/))\n",

    "If they can't handle a baseball game that went into extra innings, the World Cup is going to be an absolute nightmare.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, here's what needs to happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Unprecedented special event service**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not just \"extra buses.\" We're talking:\n",
    "- Consider dedicated **shuttle bus loops** running continuously between BMO Field and major subway stations (Union, Osgoode, King, Dundas West)\n",
    "- **Triple or quadruple frequency** on all 10 BMO Field routes during the 2-hour post-game window\n",
    "- Run every route at **2-3 minute headways** (yes, that's insane, but that's what the math requires)\n",
    "- Deploy **every available vehicle** - pull from other parts of the city if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Extended late-night service**\n",
    "\n",
    "Games end around 10 PM, but with 40k people leaving, it'll take 2-3 hours to clear. Need to:\n",
    "- Extend **all subway lines until at least 1-2 AM** on game nights\n",
    "- Keep **surface routes running until midnight or later**\n",
    "- Coordinate with Metrolinx for extended GO/UP Express service (and actually communicate this time)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Clear communication strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Series fiasco? That was largely a communication disaster. For the World Cup:\n",
    "- **Announce the plan weeks in advance** - don't leave fans guessing\n",
    "- **Real-time updates** on Twitter/apps showing where buses/streetcars actually are\n",
    "- **Multilingual signage** at BMO Field directing people to specific routes\n",
    "- **Staff on the ground** at major stops to manage crowds and answer questions\n",
    "- **Contingency plans** if games run late, and actually tell people about them before the game\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Traffic management**\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface transit is already slow. During World Cup, it'll be gridlock unless:\n",
    "- **Dedicated transit lanes** on King, Dufferin, and Exhibition during game hours\n",
    "- **Street closures** to prevent car traffic from clogging bus/streetcar routes\n",
    "- Police/traffic officers managing intersections\n",
    "\n",
    "**What won't work:** Hoping people spread out evenly. Hoping vehicles show up on time. Hoping the infrastructure magically handles it. The World Series proved that \"hoping\" doesn't cut it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For fans (you and me)\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it real, the TTC is probably going to struggle no matter what. So here's how to avoid being one of those people tweeting angrily at 1 AM:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best routes to take:**\n",
    "- **929 Dufferin Express** - most frequent, most consistent (but will be absolutely packed)\n",
    "- **63 Ossington** - decent frequency and CV, gets you to Ossington subway\n",
    "- **Exhibition GO** - if Metrolinx actually extends service (big if)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routes to avoid:**\n",
    "- **504 King streetcar** - worst consistency score, will bunch up and create chaos\n",
    "- **503 Kingston Rd streetcar** - poor reliability, serves fewer useful destinations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timing strategy:**\n",
    "- **Leave 5-10 minutes early** if the game is clearly decided. Yeah, you'll miss the trophy presentation, but you'll actually get home\n",
    "- **Or wait 60+ minutes** after the final whistle. Let the initial surge clear out, grab food/drinks nearby, then take transit when it's calmer\n",
    "- **Don't try to leave right at final whistle** - that's when everyone else is leaving and when the system will be most overloaded\n",
    "\n",
    "**Have a backup plan:**\n",
    "- Consider **biking** to BMO Field if weather allows - Bike Share stations nearby\n",
    "- Identify **walking routes** to other subway stations (Dundas West is ~25 min walk)\n",
    "- Team up with friends who drove and split parking costs\n",
    "- Download **Uber/Lyft** before the game (cell networks will be overloaded after)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What FIFA/City of Toronto should do\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly? They should be loudly communicating that **not everyone can take transit** to these games. \n",
    "\n",
    "Encourage:\n",
    "- **Walking/biking infrastructure** - make it actually safe and appealing to not use transit\n",
    "- **Staggered arrival/departure** - incentivize people to arrive super early or stay late\n",
    "- **Park-and-ride options** - set up lots outside the city with dedicated shuttle buses\n",
    "- **Hotel packages** for out-of-town fans - stay downtown, walk or short transit ride\n",
    "\n",
    "The hard truth: Toronto built a 40,000-seat stadium without rapid transit access, and there's no fixing that in 7 months. The only way this works is if far fewer than 40,000 people try to use transit at the same time.\n"
